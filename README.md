# Text-to-PDF Converter

This GAN application converts input text into a PDF document with text rendered in an artistic style.

## Features

The application uses images of stylized characters to render input text into an image, which is then compiled into a PDF document.

### Text Rendering

- Supports rendering of alphanumeric characters, punctuation marks, and spaces.
- Converts each word of the input text into stylized images.
- Adds random spacing and line breaks for visual variety.

### PDF Generation

- Utilizes the `FPDF` library to compile rendered images into a PDF document.
- Each page of the PDF contains a sequence of rendered images representing text lines.
